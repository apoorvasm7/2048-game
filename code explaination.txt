import pygame
This line imports the pygame library, which is commonly used for multimedia applications, including sound playback.


import time
This line imports the time module, which is used later to add a pause between questions.


class QuizGame:This line defines a class named QuizGame, encapsulating the functionality of the quiz game.


def __init__(self, questions):This line defines the constructor method __init__ for the QuizGame class. It initializes the instance variables, including the list of questions, and loads sound files using pygame.mixer.Sound.


pygame.init()This line initializes the pygame module. It needs to be called before using any other pygame functions.


self.correct_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("correct.wav")
self.incorrect_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("incorrect.wav")
These lines load sound files ("correct.wav" and "incorrect.wav") into pygame.mixer.Sound objects, which will be used for playing sounds later.


self.questions = questions
self.score = 0
These lines initialize the instance variables questions (a list of quiz questions) and score (the user's score, initially set to 0).


def play_sound(self, is_correct):This line defines a method named play_sound within the QuizGame class. It takes a boolean parameter is_correct and plays either the correct or incorrect sound based on the provided argument.


if is_correct:
    self.correct_sound.play()
else:
    self.incorrect_sound.play()
These lines use the play() method on the appropriate pygame.mixer.Sound object to play the corresponding sound based on whether the answer is correct.


def ask_question(self, question, options, correct_option):
This line defines a method named ask_question within the QuizGame class. It takes parameters for a single question, options, and the correct answer.


print(question)This line prints the current question.


for i, option in enumerate(options, start=1):
    print(f"{i}. {option}")
These lines use enumerate to print the multiple-choice options with their corresponding numbers.


user_answer = input("Your answer (enter the number): ")
This line prompts the user to input their answer and stores it in the user_answer variable.


if user_answer.isdigit() and 1 <= int(user_answer) <= len(options):
This line checks if the user input is a digit and within the valid range of options.


if options[int(user_answer) - 1] == correct_option:
    print("Correct!")
    self.play_sound(True)
    self.score += 1
If the user's answer is correct, it prints "Correct!", plays the correct sound, and increments the user's score.


else:
    print(f"Wrong! The correct answer is: {correct_option}")
    self.play_sound(False)
If the user's answer is incorrect, it prints the correct answer and plays the incorrect sound.


else:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
If the user's input is not a valid digit, it informs the user of invalid input.


def start_quiz(self):
This line defines a method named start_quiz within the QuizGame class.


for i, (question, options, correct_option) in enumerate(self.questions, start=1):
This line iterates through the list of questions using enumerate and unpacks each tuple into question, options, and correct_option.


print(f"\nQuestion {i}:")
This line prints the question number.


self.ask_question(question, options, correct_option)
time.sleep(1)
These lines call the ask_question method for each question, adding a one-second pause between questions.


print(f"\nQuiz completed! Your final score is: {self.score}/{len(self.questions)}")
This line prints the final score after all questions have been answered.


pygame.mixer.quit()
This line quits the pygame.mixer module after the quiz is completed.


questions_list = [
    ("What is the capital of France?", ["Berlin", "Madrid", "Paris", "Rome"], "Paris"),
    ("Which programming language is this quiz written in?", ["Python", "Java", "C++", "JavaScript"], "Python"),
    ("What is the largest mammal?", ["Elephant", "Blue Whale", "Giraffe", "Lion"], "Blue Whale"),
]This is an example list of questions, each represented as a tuple with the question, options, and correct answer.


quiz = QuizGame(questions_list)
quiz.start_quiz()
These lines create an instance of the QuizGame class with the provided list of questions and start the quiz using the start_quiz method
